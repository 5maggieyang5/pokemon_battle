# Pokemon_Battle Project

Use Pokéapi (https://pokeapi.co/) to evaluate the type advantages of two Pokémon. It takes two Pokémon and determine which one has the favourable type advantage.
- In the case of no type advantage the “winner” should be the Pokémon with the highest base stats.
- In the case of a tie the “winner” should be the first Pokémon passed to it.
